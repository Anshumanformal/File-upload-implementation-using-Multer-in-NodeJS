# File-upload-implementation-using-Multer-in-NodeJS
Implementation of file upload using multer in NodeJS.

1. Here, I have created an express application, which can be used to upload files to the server.
2. Depending upon the requirements, we can configure route to upload single or multiple media files at the same time.
3. This is a boilerplate code which can be integrated into any existing NodeJS application.
